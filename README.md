# Portfolio-Management-Investment-Analysis-Fundamentals-in-Python

Two of the main reasons for using Python can be found in Finance. It is a powerful computational tool when we have to solve complicated mathematical operations and it gives us flexibility when working with large amount of data. In this project we will explore a wide range of financial analysis and visualizations using Python.

Calculate and compare the performance of stocks and stocks indicies
# a. Install must-have Packages for finance

Numpy: a third-party package allowing us to work with multidimensional arrays
Pandas: allows us to organize data in a tabular form and to attach descriptive labels to the rows and columns of the table
Matplotlib: a two-dimensional plotting library specially designed for visualizations of NumPy computations
Math: involves mathematical functions
Random: invokes random number of generators
Statsmodels: Descriptive statistics, plotting functions, regressions, etc.
Pandas_datareader: Extension to read data from web
